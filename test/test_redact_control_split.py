"""Control-split tokens must not bypass the batch redactors, WITHOUT losing byte fidelity.

``redact_credentials`` and ``redact_exfiltration_urls`` decide by matching a pattern
against the text as given, so a control or invisible character spliced mid-token splits
the token, no pattern matches, and the text egresses carrying the credential for any
consumer that drops the splitting bytes to reassemble it.

:func:`kiro_crew.security.redact_control_split` scans a NORMALISED COPY, computes the
redaction spans on it, and maps those spans back onto the ORIGINAL bytes -- redacting the
original in place rather than returning the normalised text -- so the roughly 216 callers
that want byte fidelity (a file snapshot, an attachment) keep their exact bytes except
where a credential lives.

These tests pin both halves of the guarantee: a control-split token that evades the raw
redactor is caught, AND a byte-fidelity caller's bytes are unchanged except at the mapped
redaction spans. Separators are spelled as explicit ``bytes`` so the case under test is
the byte sequence, not an editor's rendering of it.
